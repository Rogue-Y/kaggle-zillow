# Ensembling prediction result
# TODO(hzn):
#   *1. how to record ensembling experiements result
#   *2. how to envaluate ensembling in cv rather than submit the result, predictions
#       actually contains the training houses
#   *3. following the above one, how to automatically tune ensembling
#   *3. adjust for resale first or ensembling first (mathematically the same,
#       but the adjust offset could be different for different ensembling, also
#       the adjustment may affect validation, validation should be made with
#       pre-adjusted predictions)
